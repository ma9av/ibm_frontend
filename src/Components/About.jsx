      The Know Your Air is a platform that aims to provide a real-time user-friendly AQI (Air Quality Index) data to help individuals and communities monitor or check air quality and make informed others about their health and daily activities. As air pollution becomes an increasing concern globally, our platform seeks to empower individuals and communities with accurate and timely AQI data. This platform aims to raise the awareness about air pollution levels and the percentage of components of air. By offering comprehensive data and resources, the platform seeks to educate the public, support health professionals, assist environmental activists, and inform government agencies. Additionally, the website will provide customizable alerts for significant changes in air quality, ensuring users stay informed and can take necessary precautions. In short, our objective is to enhance public knowledge, support health professionals and activists, and assist government agencies in their efforts to improve air quality and protect public health.
